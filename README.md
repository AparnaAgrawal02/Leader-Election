# Abstract
    Leader election is an important problem in distributed computing, where nodes in a
    network elect one of themselves as a leader. The leader is responsible for performing
    certain tasks that require coordination and consensus. There are several algorithms for
    leader election, each with different characteristics and performance trade-offs. The goal
    of this project is to implement and experiment with different leader election algorithms
    for various topologies and study their performance in terms of the number of messages
    exchanged.

# 1. Introduction
    In distributed systems, a leader election algorithm is used to choose a single process
    from a group of processes to act as the leader. The leader is responsible for coordinating
    the actions of the other processes and ensuring that the system operates correctly. In
    this project, we present an experimental approach based on an MPI (Message Passing
    Interface) implementation, with the goal to characterize the relevant evaluation metrics
    based on statistical processing of the results.
## 1.1 Problem Statement
    We consider a set of N processes p1, ..., pN that (i) have no shared variables, and (ii)
    can communicate by message passing. From this set, we want to select one process to
    play a special role (e.g. coordinator), such that (i) every process pi should have the
    same coordinator, (ii) if the elected process fails a new election round is started. In
    order to be able to make this choice, we assume that each process has a unique ID, and
    the problem is to elect the process with the largest ID. This ID could e.g. be related to
    the inverse of the load on the process, in order to elect a relatively unloaded process.
    This problem statement implies that IDs are unique and that IDs are totally ordered.
## 1.2 Objectives
    • To implement and test different leader election algorithms, including Bully Algorithm, LeLang Chang Roberts (LCR) and Hirschberg–Sinclair.
    • Explore and analyse Synchronous and Asynchronous algorithms.
    • To experiment with the implemented algorithms on different network topologies,
    including random, ring, and mesh topologies, and record the number of messages
    exchanged during the leader election process.
## 2. Related Work
    The first leader election algorithm was designed for the ring network. In 1977, G. Le
    Lann proposed this algorithm which is also known as the Ring algorithm. It works
    on an asynchronous and unidirectional ring network. In 1979, Chang et al. improved
    the Ring algorithm and proposed the LCR algorithm. This algorithm also works on
    the unidirectional logical ring network. Though this algorithm reduces the message
    overhead of the election process and its time overhead is high. Hirschberg and Sinclair
    proposed the HS algorithm for a bidirectional ring network. This algorithm reduces
    the message complexity of the election process from O(N2) to O(NlogN), but its time
    complexity is very high. Biswas and Dutta proposed the Timer-based Leader Election
    Algorithm for the unidirectional synchronous logical ring network.   
    No leader election algorithm has been designed considering the failure-recovery
    failure model for the ring network to elect a reliable leader. Most of the existing
    1
    algorithms considered that node or link failures or recovery do not occur during the
    election which is not the case in practical scenarios.
    In 1982, Gracia Molina introduced the Bully algorithm that works on a complete
    mesh network. Kordafshari et al. presented the Modified Bully algorithm to overcome
    the drawbacks of the Bully algorithm. Mega-Merger is one of the earliest leader election
    algorithms designed for arbitrary network topology. Robert Gray Gallager developed
    it at MIT in 1983. The Yo-Yo is a leader election algorithm designed for arbitrary
    network topology. Unlike the Mega-Merger algorithm, Yo-Yo has simple specifications,
    and its correctness is simple to establish.
## 3. Evaluation Metrics
    There are two important metrics to characterize the performance of algorithms for leader election:
    3.1 Turnaround time
    The time needed for the election (measured from the moment the election process is
    started until all processes have agreed on a common coordinator).
    3.2 Bandwidth/Communication Complexity
    The number of messages used to elect a new coordinator.
## 4. Ring Topology
    Rings are a simple starting point to analyse leader election algorithms in distributed
    systems. The lower bounds and impossibility results for ring topology also apply to
    arbitrary topologies. There is no leader election algorithm for anonymous rings, even
    if the algorithm knows the ring size (non-uniform) and in the synchronous model.
    4.1 LeLang Chang Roberts(LCR) Algorithm
    Describe what you did in order to use the data for analysis.
    4.2 Franklin Algorithm
    Describe what you did in order to use the data for analysis.
    4.3 Hirschberg–Sinclair(HS) Algorithm
    Assumptions
    • Bidirectional
    2
    • Don’t know ring size
    • Comparisons only for UID’s
    Types of Messages
    • send data tag
    • return data tag
    Algorithm
    Each process operates in phases 0, 1, 2... In each phase k, process i sends messages
    with send data tag with its UID in both directions to travel distance 2k and return
    back to it. If both tokens return then process i continues in phase k+1.
    • A process checks the received UID with its own when it gets an message with
    send data tag UID.
    • If the received UID is smaller, then it discards it
    • If the received UID is greater then
    – it passes it to the next process, if it is not the end of its path.
    – else it returns it back to the previous one and travels back to the originating
    process with tag return data tag
    • If it is equal, then the process declares itself the leader
    Complexity Analysis
    A processor initiating messages along paths of length 2 i causes messages to emanate
    in both directions, and return
    T OT AL = 4.(1.n + 2.(n/2) + · · · 2
    i
    .(n/(2i−1 + 1)). . .) = O(n log n)
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    
## 5. Complete topology
    a complete network refers to a network topology where each node is directly connected
    to every other node in the network. In other words, it is a fully connected network,
    where every node can communicate directly with every other node without the need
    for any intermediate nodes or links.
    
        5.1 Bully Algorithm
        Assumptions
        • Each node has a unique ID.
        • System is synchronous
        • Every process knows the process number of all other processes
        • Processes do not know which processes are currently up and which processes are
        currently down
        • In the election, a process with the highest process number is elected as a coordinator which is agreed by other alive processes
        Types of Messages
        • ELECTION
        • OK
        • COORDINATOR
        Algorithm
        1. A process with ID i initiates the election
        2. It sends ELECTION messages to all process with ID > i
        3. Any process upon receiving the ELECTION message returns an OK to its predecessor and starts an election of its own by sending ELECTION to higher ID
        processes.
        4. If it receives no OK messages, it knows it is the highest ID process in the system.
        It thus sends COORDINATOR message to all other processes
        5. If it received OK messages, it knows it is no longer in contention and simply
        drops out and waits for an COORDINATOR message from some other process.
        6. Any process that receives COORDINATOR message treats the sender of that
        message as coordinator
        Complexity Analysis
        When the process having the lowest priority number detects the coordinator’s failure
        and initiates an election, in a system of n processes, altogether (n-2) elections are
        performed. For each election ever process sends the election message to each process
        greater than him and sends OK to each process lesser than him
        NUMOK = 0 + 1 + 2 . . . n − 3 =
        (n − 3)(n − 2)
        2
        NUMElections = 0 + 1 + 2 . . . n − 2 =
        (n − 3)(n − 2)
        2
        4
        Message Complexity = O(n
        2
        )
        Time Complexity = O(3)
  ## 6. Arbitrary topology
      6.1 FloodMax Algorithm
      Assumptions
      • Process is Arbitrarily connected
      • Each Process Knows the diameter of the Graph
      • System is synchronous
      • In the election, a process with the highest process number is elected as a coordinator
      Types of Messages
      • MAX UID
      Algorithm
      1. A process is made a simulator that calculates the Diameter using BFS traversals
      and sends it to the processes involved.
      2. Each Process sends/floods max MAX UID it knows so far to each process it is
      connected to.
      3. Each time a process receives a UID it updates its MAX UID to the maximum it
      has seen so far.
      4. Above Two steps is repeated for the diameter number of rounds.
      5. After completing the diameter number of rounds, each node will have the max
      UID it has seen so far which will also be the global maximum; thus every node
      will know who is the leader of the network.
      Complexity Analysis
      To elect a leader it takes
      6.2 Echo with Extinction
      Each process in a distributed system is allowed to initiate a run of the Echo Algorithm
      with its own process ID as the tag. The process with the smallest ID among all the
      initiators will complete its wave, and the process that initiated this wave becomes the
      leader.
      5
      Types of Messages
      • TOKEN
      • LEADER
      Algorithm
      • Each initiator starts a wave, tagged with its id by sending TOKEN,ID messages
      • At any time, each process takes part in at most one wave.
      • If a process p in wave cawp is hit by a wave r:
      – if cawp > r, then p changes to wave r (Reinitialize the algorithm);
      – if cawp < r , then p continues with wave q (the message is ignored – extinction );
      – if cawp = r, then the incoming message is treated according to the echo
      algorithm of wave cawp
      • I If wave p executes a decide event (at p), p becomes leader
      Complexity Analysis
      When everyone initiates their own wave. Worst-case message complexity: O(N.E)
